            <p>A recurring debate amongst internet people is that SNL is getting worse, and that the "XYZ" era was <em>the best</em> season of SNL.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ugh the best era &lt;3</p>&mdash; cass (@_cassieroberts_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_cassieroberts_/status/1758317671320608880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

            <p>As an avid casual watcher of SNL, I have my favourites too (Lonely Island era was the best, no questions asked). But I wondered if the quality of SNL was <em>actually</em> declining.</p>

            <p>To investigate, I decided to look at the data, and this was what I found out:</p>

            <img src="static/snl-chart.png" alt="A bar chart that shows SNL ratings across seasons. There isn't much variance across seasons.">

            <p>For all talk that people spout, the ratings don't actually vary that drastically across the 46 seasons I look at in the dataset.</p>

            <p>Season 3 scored the highest with an average episode rating of 7.2. The cast during this season was: </p>

            <p>On the flip side, Season 28 was the worst scoring season, with an average episode rating of 5.4. The cast during this season was:</p>
