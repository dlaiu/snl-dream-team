            <p>A recurring debate amongst internet people is that SNL is getting worse, and that the "XYZ" era was <em>the best</em> season of SNL.</p>

            <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ugh the best era &lt;3</p>&mdash; cass (@_cassieroberts_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_cassieroberts_/status/1758317671320608880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 16, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

            <p style="padding-top: 1em;">And not infrequently, comments like this can be seen on their YouTube videos:</p>

            <img src="static/snl-bad-comment-1.png" alt="YouTube comment that says 'I'm convinced that SNL is doing some kind of social experiment to see how long we'll keep watching.'">

            <img src="static/snl-bad-comment-2.png" alt="YouTube comment that says 'Sarah Sherman just sucks And this sketch sucks'">

            <img src="static/snl-bad-comment-3.png" alt="YouTube comment that says 'I will be suing NBC for pain and suffering after this is over'">

            <p>As an avid casual watcher of SNL, I have my favourites too (Lonely Island era was the best, no questions asked). But I wondered if the quality of SNL was <em>actually</em> declining.</p>

            <p>To investigate, I decided to look at the data, and this was what I found out:</p>

            <img src="static/snl-chart.png" alt="A bar chart that shows SNL ratings across seasons. There isn't much variance across seasons.">

            <p>For all the talk that people spout, the ratings don't actually vary that drastically across the 46 seasons I look at in the dataset.</p>

            <p>Season 3 scored the highest with an average episode rating of 7.2. The cast during this season was: </p>

            <img src="static/snl-season-3-cast.png" alt="">

            <p>Ironically, this season had quite a lot of off-screen drama.</p>
            
            <p>According to Wikipedia, this was the season where original cast member Chevy Chase returned to host. The cast was allegedly resentful and Bill Murray and Chevy Chase apparently fought.</p>

            <p>And yet, Season 28 was the worst scoring season, with an average episode rating of 5.4. The cast during this season was:</p>

            <img src="static/snl-season-4-cast.png" alt="">

            <p>But somehow, in 2002, it was ranked 10th on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV shows of All Time.</p>

            <p>So, it seems that the quality of SNL doesn't actually vary that much across seasons. But I also wanted to know about the cast. How did the cast members stack up against each other?</p>

            <p>This was a bit trickier. Ratings are usually for an entire episode so casts members don't get individual ratings. And with a variety show like SNL, how do you quantify how much a cast member actually contributed to it?</p>

            <p>I decided attribute a cast member's particular score for an episode with proportional number of sketches they appeared in a particular episode. For example, if Chevy Chase appeared in 7 out of 13 sketches in the first episode, his rating of that episode would be 7/13 of the score of that episode.</p>

            <p>Using that metric, here are the top 17 cast members of all time.</p>

            <p>Or the <em>dream team</em> if you will:</p>

            <p>I think Kenan Thompson should be on the list but I guess if the data says he shouldn't then it must be true.</p>
